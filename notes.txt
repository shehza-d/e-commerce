I am Shehzad Iqbal, a motivated and dedicated individual with a
technical background in Node.js and REST API development.
With over a year of experience, I have worked on several open-source projects,
including the official website of the Governor of Sindh,
where I implemented a form submission feature using Next.js and a REST API
connected to a PostgreSQL database. I have also contributed to an
E-commerce web store built on the MERN stack, integrating JWT authentication,
Context API, and Stripe payments methods. Additionally,
I have developed REST APIs using Node.js and implemented file uploads to Firebase storage buckets.
My proficiency in full-stack web development, RESTful architecture, and API design,
combined with my problem-solving skills, make me a strong fit for the LFX Open Mainframe project.
I am eager to collaborate with the team and contribute to the automation and management of CVEs.

Thank you for considering my application. I have attached my resume for your review,
and I would welcome the opportunity to discuss further how my qualifications align with
the project's requirements.
